# GLIA Funding Tracker

A free, self-running list of open funding opportunities for water and water-adjacent startups, built for the [gener8tor Great Lakes Innovation Accelerator](https://www.gener8tor.com/greatlakes) cohort. Founders can copy it and keep it running on their own GitHub account after the program, at no cost.

Every day a GitHub job pulls public funding sources, keeps the listings that are still open, and saves them in one common format.

## What's in it

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| [`data/listings.csv`](data/listings.csv) | Every open listing from every source |
| [`data/matches.csv`](data/matches.csv) | The listings that fit [`profile.toml`](profile.toml) |
| [`data/filtered_out.csv`](data/filtered_out.csv) | Listings that fit the keywords but were removed because a startup could not bid (certification-only set-aside, construction bid, off-topic bid for supplies or building services, or a grant that rules out businesses), with the reason in the last column |
| [`data/archive/`](data/archive) | Water listings that have closed, one file per year (starting 2026), kept for looking back at what funders offer and when |
| [`data/summary.csv`](data/summary.csv) | Today's counts per source and per kind, stage and who can apply (feeds the sheet's About tab) |
| [`profile.toml`](profile.toml) | Keywords and eligibility rules that decide what counts as a match |

Each row has the same columns whatever the source. Six plain columns come right after the title and funder, so every listing reads the same way:

| Column | Values |
| --- | --- |
| kind | Grant, Contract, Prize, Accelerator, Pitch competition, Pilot, Loan, Funding notice |
| stage | Open (apply now), Coming soon (announced, not open yet), Info request (the buyer is asking questions before a bid) |
| deadline | Closing date, or "Not set" for rolling and forecast listings |
| amount | "Up to $500K" from the award ceiling, or "$3.5M total" from total funding, when the source gives one |
| who_can_apply | Any company, Companies eligible, Small businesses only, Check listing, Not companies |
| short_summary | The first sentences of the summary |

The source's own wording follows: listing type, status, post and close dates, award floor and ceiling, total funding, eligibility, eligibility notes, topics, location, link, the full summary, and the dates the tracker first and last saw the listing.

If one source fails on a given day, the others still update and that source keeps its previous listings. The run shows as failed in the Actions tab so you notice.

Only free, public sources are used. Sites that need a login are left out.

## Calendar of yearly programs

Some of the best programs for water startups (Imagine H2O, BREW, Techstars WaterTech, Cleantech Open, the Google water RFI) open once a year on pages with no feed. Their dates are kept by hand in the **Calendar** tab of the Google Sheet, one row per program per round:

| Column | What to put |
| --- | --- |
| program, run_by, kind | Name, who runs it, and Accelerator, Prize, Grant, Pilot or Pitch competition |
| opens, closes | Dates as YYYY-MM-DD; leave blank when not announced |
| rolling | "yes" for programs that take applications any time |
| amount, who_can_apply, location | e.g. "Up to $10K", "Any company" or "Illinois small businesses", "Milwaukee, WI" |
| usual_window | When it usually opens, e.g. "October to November", for planning next year |
| link, about, notes | The apply page and a sentence or two |
| last_checked | The date someone last confirmed the row |

Each morning the job reads the tab (the sheet must be shared as "anyone with the link can view"; the address is in `profile.toml` under `[calendar]`) and keeps a copy in `data/calendar.csv`. Rounds that are open, rolling, or announced but not yet open go into the pool and always count as matches; closed rounds move to the archive, which builds a record of when each program runs. The About tab lists rows that need an update: a round that closed with no next round, a program with no dates, or a row not checked in 90 days. Updating the calendar once a quarter keeps it current.

## View it in Google Sheets

The script in [`sheet/refresh.gs`](sheet/refresh.gs) fills a **Matches** tab and an **About** tab (sources, today's counts, how matching works) and refreshes both every day. Setup steps are at the top of the file.

For a quick read-only view instead, make a new Google Sheet and put this in cell A1. It refreshes on its own about once an hour.

```
=IMPORTDATA("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gauravshikhargandhi-web/glia-funding-tracker/main/data/matches.csv")
```

Swap `matches.csv` for `listings.csv` to see everything. If you run your own copy, swap in your GitHub username and repository name.

## Run your own copy

1. Click **Use this template**, then **Create a new repository**, on this page. A public repository keeps GitHub Actions free.
2. Edit `profile.toml` in your copy so the keywords describe what you build.
3. Open the **Actions** tab, enable workflows if GitHub asks, choose **Daily refresh**, and click **Run workflow**.

From then on it refreshes every day at 12:00 UTC. GitHub pauses scheduled jobs on repositories with no activity for 60 days, but the daily data update counts as activity.

## Run it on your computer

Needs Python 3.11 or newer and nothing else.

```
python -m tracker.run
python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
```
